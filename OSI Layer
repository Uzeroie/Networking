OSI stands for Open System Interconnection Layers. It communicates diffrent computers or end devices. It is not used these days since TCP model is into practice these days.
It has 7 layers and all of these layers have their own functions. 
PDNTSPA or APSTNDP
Layer 7 is Application Layer - It is the layer where the end users interact directly with software. It also recives data directly from the user and displays the recuired data to the end users. for example : google, MS word etc. The layer itself doesnot consist of software it only helps in communication.
Layer 6 is Presentation Layer - Presentation Layer prepares and presents data to application layer. It helps in encoding, encrypting and compressing data to send the data to other end without any error.
Layer 5 is Session Layer - When any two end devices need to communicate with each other a session is created and it is created in session layer. It first opens session for communication ensures they remain open throoughout the data transfer and also closes them when the session ends. 
Layer 4 is Transport Layer - This layer transports the data from end devices to servers and back. Its main purpose is to transmit important data check error in data and also see the size of data speed ofdata flow etc. Its example is TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) 
Layer 3 is Network Layer - This layer is solely responsible for traffic forwarding and it also connects diffrent routers. This layer contains most of the functioning of the router. The Network layer finds the destination of end devices using IP address.
Layer 2 is Data-Link Layer - Data-Link layer connects two node devices. Node devices are called end devices some examples of nodes are routers, pcs, printers etc. It also corrects errors of Physical layer. It has 2 sub layers they are: LLC (Logical Link Control) - It provides flow and error control throughout physical Layer and It also Identifies line portocol. MAC (Media Access Control) - It uses MAC address to connect the end devices and also control permission on Transmission and recival of data.
Layer 1 is Physical Layer - Physical layer is the bottom of the OSI Layer/Model. It connects computers or network physically using wirecables. It transmits raw data in the form of 0 and 1. It can include wires, wifi, pins, voltage etc. When there is any sort of network problem, the experts check the phyical layer first to see if all the wires are connected throughly or not.
